## Quick Web Boilerplate

Modern boilerplate for quick web prototyping, blazing fast hot-reload updates. `SASS` as CSS preprocessor.

* Install:
    * App dependencies: `yarn`
* Run:
    * `yarn start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with hot reload.
    * `yarn build` — builds minified project for production to `dist` folder
* Learn:
    * All directories/files are copied to `dist/` directory.
    * `*.js`, `*.scss` and `*.html` files are processed (compilation / minification / sourcemaps)
