# Brunch + Babel/ES6

This is a modern front-end boilerplate powered by [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `yarn global add brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `yarn`
* Run:
    * `yarn start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `yarn build` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
